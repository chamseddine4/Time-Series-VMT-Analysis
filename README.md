# 📊 Time-Series Analysis – Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)

This project performs statistical and graphical analysis of monthly time-series data showing **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)** in the US, using data from **January 1972 to December 2008**.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

Analyze long-term transportation trends by exploring the structure, seasonality, and behavior of VMT data over a 36-year period using Python and statistical visualization.

---

## 📁 Project Contents

- `VMT_TimeSeries_Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Visualizations (trend, seasonality, anomalies)
  - Stationarity tests (ADF, rolling mean/variance)
  - Lag plots, ACF/PACF graphs
  - Data decomposition

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- Time-series visualization (line plots, rolling averages)
- Seasonal decomposition (`statsmodels`)
- ACF and PACF analysis
- Detrending and stationarity checks (ADF test)
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `seaborn`

## 📈 Sample Outputs

> 🕵️‍♂️ Clear upward trend over time  
> 📉 Rolling mean smooths seasonal variation  
> 🔄 Seasonality visible in monthly traffic volume
